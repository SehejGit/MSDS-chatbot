    "bot_response": "Hi there! Great question about the prerequisite courses for the MSDS program.\n\nWe require three prerequisite courses for admission: Inferential Statistics, Linear Algebra, and a Programming course. We also *highly* recommend having coursework in Calculus and Data Structures under your belt, as they'll be super helpful in the program.\n\nTo help you figure out if the courses you've already taken (or are planning to take) meet our requirements, check out the \"How to Apply\" page on our website. There, you'll find a list of key concepts you should understand for each subject. We also have an FAQ page with a list of pre-approved institutions and their equivalent courses \u2013 and even the corresponding USF undergraduate courses that fulfill the prerequisites!\n\nIf you're still unsure after reviewing those resources, feel free to email us with the course description and the name of the institution where you took the course(s). We're happy to help you figure it out!\n\nDon't worry if you're missing a prerequisite or two. Many students take them before starting the program. Good luck with your application! We're excited to hear from you.\n"
