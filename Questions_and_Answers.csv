"I had a question about the formatting of the statement of purpose for the MSDS program. I noticed that USF’s MSCS program specifies formatting preferences for the statement of purpose, such as single-spacing and font size, but I couldn’t find similar guidelines for the MSDS program. In my submission, I used double spacing and did not include a title for my SOP. Would that be considered acceptable?","We don't have any specific requirements for the statement formatting, so what you submitted is fine. "
"I had one last question, as an applicant who is currently completing my undergraduate degree, I was wondering if an offer of admissions would include conditional terms? For example, would acceptance be contingent on meeting a certain GPA or would acceptance be contingent on just being able to successfully graduate and receive a Bachelor's degree?","The only condition there could be is completion of an in progress prerequisite, and of course, a conferral of bachelor's degree. GPA is only evaluated at the time of admission review. "
"Is there any assistance you can provide, such as securing Graduate Assistantship sponsorship, to help me fund my chosen course or program, given that I have been informed there is no available funding and I am unable to cover the fees independently?","All admitted candidates will be considered for program scholarships, which will be detailed in the admission letter. No separate application is required. However, please note that our scholarships cover a maximum of 20% of tuition, so students will need to secure additional funding sources for the program.  You can check the Program Overview (https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/programs/graduate/data-science/program-overview) and FAQs (https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/programs/graduate/data-science/faqs) for additional information. "
"If I lack formal, credited coursework in the prerequisite subjects, would my application still be considered, or is such an absolute admission requirement?",We do prefer to see formal coursework in all three areas of prerequisites. It would be very unlikely for a candidate to be admitted if they lacked such courses in all three subject areas. 
"Does this program have a STEM designation, and would it qualify for OPT extension opportunities for international students?","Yes, the program is STEM designated, with the 24 month OPT extension after the initial 12 month OPT. "
"Given my background in Fine Arts, are there any alternative ways to demonstrate my commitment and ability to succeed in this program?","We have students from a wide range of backgrounds, and welcome any major. However, given the highly accelerated pace of the program, it is important that students have a solid grasp of statistics and programming and a decent background in calculus and linear algebra in order to do well.  Our website includes a list of preapproved online courses for each prerequisite. This list is not exhaustive, any course that's taken for a letter grade and includes a proctored exam will suffice. Also, we are launching our own versions of these prerequisite courses this Spring, and they will be offered online. If you're on our mailing list, you will receive an email about these courses in the coming weeks. "
"As an applicant from India, where education loans are typically approved only after university admission, how can I fulfill the University of San Francisco's financial documentation requirements for an F-1 visa application? Does USF provide a financial declaration form or affidavit of support that can be used temporarily in place of a bank statement or loan approval?","If you plan to finance your education with a loan, you will need to obtain a letter from your bank stating that they will provide a loan for the needed amount if you are admitted. Upload this letter to the certification of finances section of the application. If you are unable to provide a letter, please contact asapplication@usfca.edu for other options. "
What are the prerequisite courses for the MSDS program?,"We require three prerequisite courses: Inferential Statistics, Linear Algebra, and a Programming course. Additionally, we strongly recommend courses in Calculus and Data Structures. If you have questions about the eligibility of courses you have taken or plan to take, please view the list of key concepts to understand for each subject on our How to Apply page. On our FAQ page, we also include a list of pre-approved institutions where you can take each of the three courses and the USF undergraduate courses that meet the criteria. If you still have questions, please email us with the course description and the name of the institution where you took the course(s). "
The MSDS FAQ indicates that certificate coursework typically doesn't replace graded academic courses for prerequisites. I am seeking clarification on whether this policy applies to the Data Institute's certificate courses.,"The Date Institute courses are accepted because they are developed by our MSDS faculty, these certificate courses may be applied towards the MSDS prerequisite course requirements. "
"Given that I am an international student, are there any additional forms of financial aid at USF that I may be eligible for, aside from the Double Dons scholarship, which I have already been awarded?","Unfortunately the Double Dons award cannot be stacked with another USF scholarship award, so external scholarships or private loans would be the other financing options for international students. "
"If additional financial aid is not available, I am considering deferring my admission by a year. Could you provide guidance on the process for deferring admission? Specifically, should I still make the $2,000 initial payment by February 15th of this year, even if I plan to defer?","Regretfully, we do not defer admissions offers. However, applicants who have been admitted once are likely to be admitted again in the subsequent year, should they need to turn down the offer and reapply. "
"I attended last week's on-campus event and am seeking advice on my application. I'm currently completing prerequisite courses at three different universities, with most concluding around April. How might this impact my application, and what steps do you recommend I take?","Completing your prerequisite courses by April will not negatively impact your application. You can proceed with your application, but it’s important to note that any admission decision will be contingent upon the successful completion of these courses. I recommend submitting transcripts or proof of enrollment for these courses along with your application and ensuring all final transcripts are submitted as soon as the courses are completed. "
"I am currently a refugee in the US, and is there any financial grant that the USF provides to refugees?","While USF does not have a specific grant exclusively for refugees, you may want to explore external funding opportunities, as well as federal financial aid options, if eligible. Also, I encourage you to reach out to the Financial Aid Office at financialaid@usfca.edu for guidance other funding resources that might apply to your situation. "
"After accepting the offer, in addition to submitting the required payment, will I need to provide my physical Green Card or any other specific ID documentation to complete my enrollment?","The university will not ask for a green card or other documentation to complete your enrollment. However, once the students are matched to their practicum company, the company's HR may require social security card and/or proof of work authorization as part of their onboarding.     "
Does your institution accept at-home GRE exam scores?,"The program does not require a GRE or GMAT test. If you have already taken either of these exams and wish to include the scores in your application, you have the choice to upload them. Nevertheless, an English Language exam score (TOEFL - 90, IELTS - 6.5, Duolingo - 115, or PTE - 61) is mandatory for international applicants. I recommend considering Duolingo as an option; it's more cost-effective and can be taken conveniently from the comfort of your home computer anytime.  If you received a Bachelor's or Master's degree or completed at least one year of full-time study in the US or one of the exempted countries, you do not need to submit a TOEFL or IELTS exam.

"Given that my GRE is scheduled for February 25th, and official scores take 10-14 days, can I submit my application before receiving the official analytical writing score, using unofficial scores for the other sections?","The program does not require a GRE or GMAT test.

"I plan to fund my studies through a combination of my father’s support and a student loan. However, the required documents, such as bank statements and loan approval, will be processed based on the scholarship I receive. Given this situation, is it possible to submit the financial documents after admission, or is it mandatory to provide them now?","Yes we can move your application forward for review without the complete Certificate of Finance if you are planning to apply for a loan and require the admission letter for your loan application.  Please upload any financial documents that you have into the Certificate of Finance section of the application, as well as a statement explaining that you intend to apply for a student loan but require the admission letter for your loan application.  When our Graduate Admission Office process your application we will then move it forward for review even if the COF is outstanding.  Please note that, if you are admitted, without a complete certificate of finance that meets or exceeds the Data Science requirement we will not be able to request your I-20. Receiving the I-20 is required to schedule a student visa appointment. "
